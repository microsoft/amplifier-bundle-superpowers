# Debugging Companion Techniques

Reference material for the 4-phase systematic debugging process. Each technique maps to specific phases where it's most useful.

| Technique | Primary Phase | When to Reach For It |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Root-Cause Tracing | Phase 1 (Investigate) | Error appears deep in call stack, unclear where bad data originated |
| Defense-in-Depth | Phase 4 (Fix) | Designing the fix — add validation at every layer, not just one |
| Condition-Based Waiting | Phase 1 + Phase 4 | Flaky tests, race conditions, timing-dependent failures |

## Root-Cause Tracing

Bugs often manifest deep in the call stack (git init in wrong directory, file created in wrong location, database opened with wrong path). Your instinct is to fix where the error appears, but that's treating a symptom.

**Core principle:** Trace backward through the call chain until you find the original trigger, then fix at the source.

**Use when:**
- Error happens deep in execution (not at entry point)
- Stack trace shows long call chain
- Unclear where invalid data originated
- Need to find which test/code triggers the problem

### The Tracing Process

#### 1. Observe the Symptom
```
Error: git init failed in /Users/jesse/project/packages/core
```

#### 2. Find Immediate Cause
**What code directly causes this?**
```typescript
await execFileAsync('git', ['init'], { cwd: projectDir });
```

#### 3. Ask: "What Called This?"
```typescript
WorktreeManager.createSessionWorktree(projectDir, sessionId)
  → called by Session.initializeWorkspace()
  → called by Session.create()
  → called by test at Project.create()
```

#### 4. Keep Tracing Up
**What value was passed?**
- `projectDir = ''` (empty string!)
- Empty string as `cwd` resolves to `process.cwd()`
- That's the source code directory!

#### 5. Find Original Trigger
**Where did empty string come from?**
```typescript
const context = setupCoreTest(); // Returns { tempDir: '' }
Project.create('name', context.tempDir); // Accessed before beforeEach!
```

### Adding Stack Traces

When you can't trace manually, add instrumentation:

```typescript
// Before the problematic operation
async function gitInit(directory: string) {
  const stack = new Error().stack;
  console.error('DEBUG git init:', {
    directory,
    cwd: process.cwd(),
    nodeEnv: process.env.NODE_ENV,
    stack,
  });

  await execFileAsync('git', ['init'], { cwd: directory });
}
```

**Critical:** Use `console.error()` in tests (not logger — may not show)

**Run and capture:**
```bash
npm test 2>&1 | grep 'DEBUG git init'
```

**Analyze stack traces:**
- Look for test file names
- Find the line number triggering the call
- Identify the pattern (same test? same parameter?)

### Real Example: Empty projectDir

**Symptom:** `.git` created in `packages/core/` (source code)

**Trace chain:**
1. `git init` runs in `process.cwd()` ← empty cwd parameter
2. WorktreeManager called with empty projectDir
3. Session.create() passed empty string
4. Test accessed `context.tempDir` before beforeEach
5. setupCoreTest() returns `{ tempDir: '' }` initially

**Root cause:** Top-level variable initialization accessing empty value

**Fix:** Made tempDir a getter that throws if accessed before beforeEach

**Also added defense-in-depth:**
- Layer 1: Project.create() validates directory
- Layer 2: WorkspaceManager validates not empty
- Layer 3: NODE_ENV guard refuses git init outside tmpdir
- Layer 4: Stack trace logging before git init

### Key Principle

**NEVER fix just where the error appears.** Trace back to find the original trigger.

The tracing flow:
1. Found immediate cause → Can you trace one level up?
2. Yes → Trace backwards → Is this the source?
3. Not the source → Keep tracing up
4. Found the source → Fix at source
5. Then add validation at each layer → Bug structurally impossible

If you can't trace further up, you've found the source. But NEVER fix just the symptom without attempting to trace.

### Stack Trace Tips

- **In tests:** Use `console.error()` not logger — logger may be suppressed
- **Before operation:** Log before the dangerous operation, not after it fails
- **Include context:** Directory, cwd, environment variables, timestamps
- **Capture stack:** `new Error().stack` shows complete call chain

## Defense-in-Depth Validation

When you fix a bug caused by invalid data, adding validation at one place feels sufficient. But that single check can be bypassed by different code paths, refactoring, or mocks.

**Core principle:** Validate at EVERY layer data passes through. Make the bug structurally impossible.

### Why Multiple Layers

Single validation: "We fixed the bug."
Multiple layers: "We made the bug impossible."

Different layers catch different cases:
- Entry validation catches most bugs
- Business logic catches edge cases
- Environment guards prevent context-specific dangers
- Debug logging helps when other layers fail

### The Four Layers

#### Layer 1: Entry Point Validation
**Purpose:** Reject obviously invalid input at API boundary

```typescript
function createProject(name: string, workingDirectory: string) {
  if (!workingDirectory || workingDirectory.trim() === '') {
    throw new Error('workingDirectory cannot be empty');
  }
  if (!existsSync(workingDirectory)) {
    throw new Error(`workingDirectory does not exist: ${workingDirectory}`);
  }
  if (!statSync(workingDirectory).isDirectory()) {
    throw new Error(`workingDirectory is not a directory: ${workingDirectory}`);
  }
  // ... proceed
}
```

#### Layer 2: Business Logic Validation
**Purpose:** Ensure data makes sense for this operation

```typescript
function initializeWorkspace(projectDir: string, sessionId: string) {
  if (!projectDir) {
    throw new Error('projectDir required for workspace initialization');
  }
  // ... proceed
}
```

#### Layer 3: Environment Guards
**Purpose:** Prevent dangerous operations in specific contexts

```typescript
async function gitInit(directory: string) {
  // In tests, refuse git init outside temp directories
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test') {
    const normalized = normalize(resolve(directory));
    const tmpDir = normalize(resolve(tmpdir()));

    if (!normalized.startsWith(tmpDir)) {
      throw new Error(
        `Refusing git init outside temp dir during tests: ${directory}`
      );
    }
  }
  // ... proceed
}
```

#### Layer 4: Debug Instrumentation
**Purpose:** Capture context for forensics

```typescript
async function gitInit(directory: string) {
  const stack = new Error().stack;
  logger.debug('About to git init', {
    directory,
    cwd: process.cwd(),
    stack,
  });
  // ... proceed
}
```

### Applying the Pattern

When you find a bug:

1. **Trace the data flow** — Where does bad value originate? Where is it used?
2. **Map all checkpoints** — List every point data passes through
3. **Add validation at each layer** — Entry, business, environment, debug
4. **Test each layer** — Try to bypass layer 1, verify layer 2 catches it

### Key Insight

All four layers were necessary. During testing, each layer caught bugs the others missed:
- Different code paths bypassed entry validation
- Mocks bypassed business logic checks
- Edge cases on different platforms needed environment guards
- Debug logging identified structural misuse

**Don't stop at one validation point.** Add checks at every layer.

## Condition-Based Waiting

Flaky tests often guess at timing with arbitrary delays. This creates race conditions where tests pass on fast machines but fail under load or in CI.

**Core principle:** Wait for the actual condition you care about, not a guess about how long it takes.

**Use when:**
- Tests have arbitrary delays (`setTimeout`, `sleep`, `time.sleep()`)
- Tests are flaky (pass sometimes, fail under load)
- Tests timeout when run in parallel
- Waiting for async operations to complete

**Don't use when:**
- Testing actual timing behavior (debounce, throttle intervals)
- Always document WHY if using arbitrary timeout

### Core Pattern

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE: Guessing at timing
await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 50));
const result = getResult();
expect(result).toBeDefined();

// ✅ AFTER: Waiting for condition
await waitFor(() => getResult() !== undefined);
const result = getResult();
expect(result).toBeDefined();
```

### Quick Patterns

| Scenario | Pattern |
|----------|---------|
| Wait for event | `waitFor(() => events.find(e => e.type === 'DONE'))` |
| Wait for state | `waitFor(() => machine.state === 'ready')` |
| Wait for count | `waitFor(() => items.length >= 5)` |
| Wait for file | `waitFor(() => fs.existsSync(path))` |
| Complex condition | `waitFor(() => obj.ready && obj.value > 10)` |

### Implementation

Generic polling function:
```typescript
async function waitFor<T>(
  condition: () => T | undefined | null | false,
  description: string,
  timeoutMs = 5000
): Promise<T> {
  const startTime = Date.now();

  while (true) {
    const result = condition();
    if (result) return result;

    if (Date.now() - startTime > timeoutMs) {
      throw new Error(`Timeout waiting for ${description} after ${timeoutMs}ms`);
    }

    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 10)); // Poll every 10ms
  }
}
```

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Polling too fast:** `setTimeout(check, 1)` — wastes CPU
**✅ Fix:** Poll every 10ms

**❌ No timeout:** Loop forever if condition never met
**✅ Fix:** Always include timeout with clear error

**❌ Stale data:** Cache state before loop
**✅ Fix:** Call getter inside loop for fresh data

### When Arbitrary Timeout IS Correct

```typescript
// Tool ticks every 100ms - need 2 ticks to verify partial output
await waitForEvent(manager, 'TOOL_STARTED'); // First: wait for condition
await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 200));   // Then: wait for timed behavior
// 200ms = 2 ticks at 100ms intervals - documented and justified
```

**Requirements:**
1. First wait for triggering condition
2. Based on known timing (not guessing)
3. Comment explaining WHY
