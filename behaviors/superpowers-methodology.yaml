    Provides 5 agents:

    - code-quality-reviewer: Code quality and best practices
    - brainstormer: Design refinement facilitation
    - plan-writer: Detailed implementation plans
    
    Core principles:
    - Design before code (brainstorm first)
    - Test-driven development (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
    - Subagent-driven development (fresh agent per task)
    - Two-stage review (spec compliance, then quality)
    - Verification before completion
